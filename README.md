**YourFlyouts** provides multiple replacements for the default Volume / Brightness flyouts in Windows which are shown while pressing the volume / brightness keys. It also works with lock, airplane mode & multimedia keys!
Along with 10 unique designs, it also provides additional customizability towards the behavioral **and** appearance side of things!

This project is heavily inspired by [ModernFlyouts](https://github.com/ModernFlyouts-Community/ModernFlyouts)! Credit to [@deathcrafter](https://github.com/deathcrafter) (trigger-plugin) and the developers of [ModernFlyouts](https://github.com/ModernFlyouts-Community/ModernFlyouts).
> Note: Built-in flyout will not be permanently affected. It will be hidden temporarily while YourFlyouts is running, hence it does not modify any system files.
> You can also use YourFlyouts to disable the flyout completely!

> Note: YourFlyouts's brightness & airplane mode flyout are not supported on Windows 11 22H2. Volume, multimedia and locks flyout is supported via legacy keyhooks, which are options you can turn on in the general settings.
